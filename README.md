## ‚å®Ô∏è An arduino project for effortless interaction with the computer üñ±Ô∏è

This project was made to help people with RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury), use their computer without experiencing pain, and prevent further damage their hands. 

## Requirements
- 5x Infared Proximity Sensors
- 1 A500k pot (A linear potentiometer would work better, but the build and the code uses a logarithmic pot) (Please keep in mind that every potentiometer is different and might need fine tuning)
- Arduino Pro Micro (or any model that supports the Keyboard.h and Mouse.h libraries)
