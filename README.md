# macropunk2022 üôè
## ‚å®Ô∏è An arduino project for effortless interaction with the computer üñ±Ô∏è

This project was made to help people with RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury), use their computer without experiencing pain, and prevent further damage their hands. 

Raise your fingers to trigger some very common shortcuts for navigation. Use the knob to scroll.

## Requirements
- 5x Infared Proximity Sensors
- 1 A500k pot (A linear potentiometer would work better, but the build and the code uses a logarithmic pot) (Please keep in mind that every potentiometer is different and might need fine tuning)
- Arduino Pro Micro (or any model that supports the Keyboard.h and Mouse.h libraries)

## Wiring

## Build with arduino-cli

    arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo MacroPunkLeo --clean

## Upload with arduino-cli

    arduino-cli upload --port /dev/cu.usbmodemHIDFG1 --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo MacroPunkLeo

## Notes

Currently this build works with mac, you can change this behaviour from the file FingerActions.h

## Future Improvements

- Smoother Knob Behaviour
- Implement Profile Switching
- Implement Some sort of switching mechanism for Mac/Windows
